# UFOs
UCB-EXT module 11

## A webpage with a dynamic table was created successfully . It works as intended with a DateTime filter. To view the UFO sighting webpage with a single DateTime filter click on "index.html" in the local respository. 
### While the project currently supports a filter by date only, the Challenge problem is to include the ability to filter by each column header. The ability to pinpoint a search by date and country, for example, would go a long way in providing more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings.
### Two new files "app_challege.js" and "index_challenge.html"  contain the code for the challenge problem. To view the Challenge prob;em's UFO sighting webpage with multiple filters click on "index_challenge.html" in the local respository.
